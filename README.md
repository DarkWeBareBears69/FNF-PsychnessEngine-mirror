# Friday Night Funkin' - Psychness Engine
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f16e995-5e3b-4802-8f79-bc4a98a40449)

This engine is a slightly advanced engine that modifies [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) 1.0.3 and adds various features.

This isn't a completely ripoff of the [Codename Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine) logo!　It's too hard to make a logo.

## How to build?
It should be the same as Psych Engine!

[Please refer to this page for how to build Psych Engine 1.x!](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/BUILDING.md)

## Examples of new features:

### Slightly modified chart editor
![PsychnessChartEditor](docs/img/chart_editor_1.png)
- A history feature has been added.
- Ctrl + O now selects all Opponent notes (within the current section only).
- Ctrl + P now selects all Player notes (within the current section only).
- A warning now appears when attempting to close the game without saving the chart.

### A completely new Lua world?

![Huh?](docs/img/script.png)

Hmm...?

![LuaFreeplay](docs/img/custom_freeplay.gif)

- Lua is now available in the Main Menu.
- You can now build a State from scratch using Lua in Custom State (the gif above was also created using this feature!).

### Make your mod stand out even more!

- Try placing an image folder named `header.png` in the same root as `pack.json`!  
  It should display as shown in the image above! (We recommend a size of 1280 × 720.)
